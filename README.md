# Wireless-self-organizing-link 
In openwrt system, use shell script and c to link wireless routers in self-organizing.

## in main file
We can use ap12.sh build an AP and use client10.sh/client11.sh to connect 192.168.1.10/(or)11. 
But, all these ways are in fixed ip, ssid, and bssid. 

## mips and arm file
We can use Wireless_self_organizing_link to auto detec AP and client in.This is updating...
